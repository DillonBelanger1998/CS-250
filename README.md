How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Taking the user's needs is understanding what they want from the program, what is the goal. In terms of the SNHU Travel project, the goal was to have a slide show of selections of vacations types and so on. User stories help with taking the info on the development of the project and tweaking it to fit the user's needs, seeing what we have and how we can change it. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs is about knowing what you want the program to do and taking the steps to make it do that goal as effecicently and smoothly as possible. That's why the development process is very important and why agile can increase that. I hope to incorporate the agile process of having communication and collaboration to make the product as best as possible.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To have a lot of communication between the rest of your team and understand that change is part of the development process. The user may want different changes made to the product at the end and will relay that constantly, being able to adapt and work with your team is what makes a good team member. Knowing what is needed from your product owner and how to implement it with the rest of your fellow developers.
